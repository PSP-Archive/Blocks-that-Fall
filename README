1. DESCRIPTION

Here is yet another game like Tetris - Blocks that Fall! Don't expect
too much from it, as the purpose of this game was to check out the
PSP homebrew devkit from PS2DEV.ORG. :)


2. USAGE

Firmware 1.5: Copy both folders to your memory card's /PSP/GAME150/. If
you want to add music to the game, put "music.mp3" to the "blocksThatFall"
directory.

Firmware 1.0: Copy EBOOT.PBP to /PSP/GAME, I guess.

Press start to start the game, and pause it. Press down to quick drop
the block. X rotates the block. Press select to toggle SFX and music
on and off.

The shoulder, square and circle buttons rotate the view for extra
challenge. Triangle button resets the view rotation.


3. CONTACT
